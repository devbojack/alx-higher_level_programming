* All your files should end with a new line
* All your files must be executable
* The first line of all your bash files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
* All `curl` commands must have the option `-s` (silent mode)
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
* The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`

* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
